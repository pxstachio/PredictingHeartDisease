# About my first project (kaggle guided).
Built machine learning models in JupyterNotebook to predict heart disease based on patient CSV health data.
Leveraged Python using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn for preprocessing data, feature engineering, and model training.
Implemented k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and optimised model performance using hyperparameter tuning. 
Achieved  86.96% accuracy with k-NN and enhanced analysis with insightful visualisations using Matplotlib.
